# MercedesBenzCodeChallenge - Car Configurator 

This repository contains a MVP mobile application that provides users with a digital car show case. The application allows users to access the latest car model releases, select a specific market, and browse through a collection of models. Users can conveniently navigate and filter the models based on vehicle class, brand name, body type, and price range.

## User Story

As a user named David, I want to access a digital car configurator on the go. The following are the key features I am looking for:

- Select a specific market to determine the collection of models to be presented.
- Categorize the retrieved models based on vehicle class for easy navigation.
- Filter the models by brand name, body type, and price range for personalized browsing.
- Examine the initial settings of a specific model, including images and other relevant information.
- Mark a model as a favorite for quick access in the future.
- Offline access to at least my favorite models, allowing me to view the information even in areas with limited connectivity.

## Technical Information

The application is built using the following technologies and libraries:

- **Hilt**: Dependency injection framework for managing dependencies.
- **Clean MVVM architecture**: A design pattern that separates the concerns of data, presentation, and interaction.
- **Compose**: A modern UI toolkit for building native UIs.
- **Room**: A database library for offline data storage and retrieval.
